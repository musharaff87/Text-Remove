we consider a critical composite superconformal
string model to desribe hadronic interactions. we present a new
approach of introducing hadronic quantum numbers in the scat-
tering amplitudes. the physical states carry the quantum num-
bers and form a common system of eigenfunctions of the opera-
tors in this string model. we give explicit constructions of the
quantum number operators.

1 introduction

in 1967 the regge hadronic resonances have been discovered. the experi-
mental data gave evidence of a typical relation between the spins i and the
square of the masses m of these strongly interacting particles [1]. it turned
out, that the resonances form the so-called regge trajectories

i(m 2) = 0 + m 2  n .

(1)

for n = 0, 1, 2, ... one nds a family of parallel linear daughter trajectories.
the constants 0 and  denote the intercept and the regge slope. the
leading -meson trajectory corresponds to n = 0.

so far qcd has not been able to explain this phenomenon. on the other
hand in the 1970s it was observed, that in string theory the mass shell
condition

(l0  a)|phys >= 0

generates a mass spectrum with parallel trajectories. the intercept a depends
on the cancellation condition of the conformal anomaly in the respective
theory. thus hadronic strings became a natural candidate for describing
the regge spectrum phenomena. however such eorts failed because of the
necessary appearance of massless states of spin one and two, which do not
correspond to physical hadronic resonances.

while these massless states gave rise to treat string theory as a fun-
damental theory of all interactions including gravity at planck energy scale,
the discrepance in hadronic string theory at typical strong interaction energy
scales of e  1 gev remained unresolved for a long time. in [7], [10] one
of the authors suggested a new critical composite superconformal hadronic
string. it consists of the neveu-schwarz (ns) superstring and a fermionic
superconformal string [5]. the ns eld components are associated with the
space-time degrees of freedom, while the fermionic sector carries the internal
degrees of freedom, namely the hadronic quantum numbers. in accordance
with the conformal anomaly cancelation in this model we have to impose new
gauge constraints on the physical states. this allows to eliminate the prob-
lematic massless states from the string mass spectrum, which now becomes
compatible with the regge resonance spectrum [7].

in this paper we present a possible explicit construction of the opera-
tors, corresponding to the hadronic quantum numbers spin, isospin, electric

charge, hyper-charge, baryon charge, strangeness, charm, beauty and top.
we give the structure of the hadronic wave functions.

in section 2 we review the main features of the composite string model and
the structure of its superconformal generator. we discuss the cancellation
of the anomaly achieved in d = 10 or d = 4 space-time dimensions and d
internal fermionic degrees of freedom. then additional d
6 3 conditions
are needed respectively for the anomaly-free solution. in section 3 we give all
gauge conditions eliminating ghosts in the physical states of the composite
string model and the spectral equations for the quantum numbers.

superconformal

in order to describe the physical hadronic states with their quantum numbers
and masses we have to consider a string model in the four dimensional space-
time. such models can be obtained by compactication of the critical ten
dimensional superstring. one way of compactication to four dimensions is
the fermionization of six dimensions [2]-[3], namely, by introducing free world
sheet fermions (,  ) carrying all internal quantum numbers of the string
[2], [5], [11]. a generalization and concrete realization of this approach has
been achieved in the critical composite superconformal string model [10],
[12]. this model unies the superconformal structures of the neveu-schwarz
operator g(n s)
[5] by introducing the
composite superconformal operator

[9] and of the fermion operator g(f )

for its superpartner in the neveu-schwarz string model. the ns-states are
given by the fock space of the products of the creation operators

yn, ym,{a

n}{b

m}|0 > .

as usual the operator gr of the composite string shall be of the conformal
weight ic = 3/2. therefore the fermion operator g(f )
is of the same conformal
weight. it can be constructed as a three-linear combination [2] of the fermion
elds a of ic = 1/2 and their currents j a of ic = 1, i.e. [5]

r

g(f )
r () = xa,b,c

abcabc + xa

j aa .

(3)

by construction g(f )
is a singlet in the quantum numbers. the fermion
operator generates all internal quantum numbers, what we show in detail in
the next section.

r

we turn now to the description of the structure of the elds a and their
currents j a, entering in (3). let   j,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, j = 1, 2 be
majorana spinor with ic = 1/2. its eight components are lorentz spinors in
 and isospinors in j simultaneously. the respective currents j a

j a = t,

 = t0 = 02,

are of conformal weight one. these currents are non-zero, if the respective
8  8 matrices t0t are antisymmetric. the matrices t can be choosen
of the form

, 5i, i, 5i, [, ].

4

thus we obtain the 28 components for the vector, axial vector, scalar, pseu-
doscalar and tensor currents

j a = t = {j v

 , j a

i, j s

i , j p

i , j t

}.

they generate a kac-moody algebra, see [4]. with these currents we asso-
ciate the respective 28 fermion components

a := {; , i, i, i, } ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(4)

these elds satisfy the standard anticommutation relations. we consider the
physical quarks as compositions of the elementary eld components (4).

we see, that the eight spinor components  generate 28 vector, axial
is

vector, scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor fermionic components. thus g(f )
a scalar in d=36 fermionic components.

r

it is well known, that the neveu-schwarz string is critical in the space-
time dimension d = 10. this comes from the condition of cancellation of
the conformal anomaly, or equivalently the nilpotency of the brst-charge
2 = 0 [3], [4]

3
2

d  26 + 11 =

(d  10) = 0.

(5)

3
2

we point out, that the new composite string remains critical for d=10. this
is due to the ghost contributions 3 from the introduced fermionic elds and
their currents [10]. indeed, in the composite model the condition (5) turns
into

3
2

d  26 + 11 + (

d  3n) =

3
2

(d  10) + (

1
2

d  3n) = 0,

(6)

where 3n denotes the ghost contribution. in the dimension d = 10 the
condition (6) is satised, if we choose n = d/6 [10].
on the other hand, compactifying the string to the space-time dimension
d = 4, we can impose n = d
6 3 gauge constraints. these gauge constraints
on the fermionic sector are used to cancel the superuous (in compairison
3the ghost contribution is given by cg = 2(6ic(ic  1) + 1), where  = 1 is the
ghost statistic for integer ic and  = 1 is the ghost statistic for half integer ic. hence n
fermions with ic = 1/2 contribute cg = n and n corresponding currents with ic = 1
contribute cg = 2n.

with the regge spectrum) states, and to shift the vacuum to g1/2|0 > .
this shift ensures the absence of a tachyon in the spectrum.
the amplitude of the hadron interactions are constructed by the opera-
tor formalism. the quantum numbers spin, isospin, electric charge, hyper-
charge, baryon charge, strangeness, charm, beauty and top and the masses of
the hadronic states are included in the structure of the hadronic wave func-
tion which enters in the vertex operator structure, and hence in the structure
of the n hadrons amplitude an .

the factorization of the amplitude gives the wave function of the cor-
responding hadronic state. this wave function contains a certain number
of components, corresponding to its experimental mass. these components
carry all hadron quantum numbers and will reproduce explicitly the quan-
tum numbers in the hadronic amplitude structure. this has been shown
in [6] where the superconformal string amplitudes for  mesons interactions
have been constructed and in [11], [12] where the general n hadrons interac-
tion amplitudes are obtained as multiparticle generalization of the lovelace-
shapiro amplitude and are treated as composite superconformal strings.

duality, crossing and cyclic symmetry for these superconformal compos-
ite string amplitudes hold together with the description of hadron quantum
numbers.

3 the quantum numbers

in this section we give a possible explicit construction of the quantum num-
bers of hadron wave functions. this wave functions shall satisfy a set of
gauge constraints

ln|phys >= 0, n > 0, gr|phys >= 0, r > 0,
which eliminate ghosts in the physical states. here ln = l(n s)
n denotes
the virasoro operator, the fermion part of which is explicitly given in the
appendix. as usual we impose the mass shell condition

n +l(f )

(7)

where the intercept 1/2 is xed by the nilpotency of the brst charge.

(l0  1/2)|phys >= 0,

(8)

6

in addition to this we have to require new gauge constraints

(l)
r |phys >= 0,

j (l)

r |phys >= 0,

l = 1, ..., n =

d
6  3,

(9)

eliminating the ghosts contributions from the added fermionic elds and their
currents. such new constraints are in agreement with the anomaly cancella-
tion condition (6). they are responsible for the reduction of the composite
string spectrum to the regge resonance spectrum. the gauge constraints
(7)-(9) build a supermultiplet ln, gr, j (l)
r with the conformal weights
ic = 2, 3

r , (l)

2 respectively.

2 , 1, 1

we search for a common system of eigenfunctions for (7)-(9) and the

spectral equations

(10)
on the remaining dn fermion components. the operator qm runs over the
quantum number operators for the spin, isospin, electric charge, hypercharge,
baryon charge, strangeness, charm, beauty and top.

qm|phys >= qm|phys >

an appropriate choice of the quantum number operators are those zero

components of the corresponding currents

(j a)0 = t a := {g(f )

r

, (a)r,}

(11)

which are number operators, i.e. count the component carrying the spin,
isospin, baryon charge and so on.

the operators (11) automatically commute with the virasoro operators

l(f )

n and g(f )

r

[l(f )

n , t a] = 0,

[g(f )

r

, t a] = 0,

what ensures the existence of a common system of eigenfunctions.

r

since g(f )

is a quantum number singlet, the charge t a carries the same
quantum numbers as the eld a. therefore the isospin operator shall be
dened as

it generates the algebra [t 

t 
i
i , t 

:= {g(f )
j ] = ijkt 

r

, (i)r}.
k and has eigenvalues

i + 1)|phys > .
analogously the lorentz spin operator is dened by

( t 
i )2|phys >= t 

i (t 

j  (kt 

) := {g(f )

r

, (k)r}

(12)

(13)

with the momentum k. the specic realization of the spin and isospin op-
erators is given in the appendix.

the baryon charge b = 1 is carried by hadron states with half-integer
lorentz spin. among the elds in (4) only  is a lorentz spinor. therefore,
if a wave function contains an even number of  components, it is a meson,
otherwise it is a baryon. thus the baryon charge is dened by

b =

1
2

(1  (1)nb )

(14)

ll is the number of spinor -elds.

where nb = pl
among the currents (11) one can not nd other operators with number
structure. on the other hand all 36 components (4) were used in the specic
realization of (12)-(14). therefore with them we can only construct meson
and baryon states containing u and d quarks. to dene the quantum numbers
strangeness s, charm c, beauty b and top t independently, we have to extend
the set (4) of 36 fermion components with an analogous partner-set of 36
eld components (lorentz scalars and isoscalars)

a := {; i, jk} ,  = 1...8, i, j, k = 1...7.

(15)

the fermion elds (15) show the following anticommutation properties

{( )r, ()s} = r,s,

 = 02,

{(i)r, (j)s} = ijr,s,
{(ij)r, (kl)s} = (ikjl  iljk)r,s,

ij = ji.

from the 8 component spinor  we can dene 28 components of the kac-
moody currents

j a = nji := i;

jjk := [i, j]o.

(16)

which are lorentz scalars and isoscalars. here i denote the 8  8 cliord
matrices, obeying the standard anticommutation relations {j, k} = 2jk.
the currents ji, jjk carry the same quantum numbers as the elds i, jk.
this guaranties the scalarity of the superconformal operator

g(f )
r () = xabc

abcabc + xa

j aa.

(17)

8

composing the superconformal operators (3) and (17)

g(f )

r = g(f )

r () + g(f )

r ()

(18)

we describe the full set of hadron quantum numbers 4.

from (12) the third isospin component in the a-space is given by

t 
3 := {g(f )

r

, (3)r}.

by construction 12  a is the partner-component to 3. therefore we dene
the isospin projection in a by

t12 := {g(f )

r

, (12)r}.

(19)

the full projection of the isospin of the hadron state corresponds to the sum

t3|phys >= (t 

3 + t12)|phys > .

(20)

in order to describe the avour quantum numbers strangeness, charm,
beauty and top we have to construct four commutating operators in a with
structure similar to the zero component of the currents j a. we will nd
them using the properties of the spinor representation of the o(6) group.
the 8 component spinors in the compactied d = 6 space transforms under
o(6). the generators of this group are given via the 8  8 i matrices by
[i, j] = 4imij,
i, j = 1...6. it holds [mij, mkl] = 0, if and only if i 6= k, l
and j 6= k, l. thus among the generators one can choose not more then three
commutating with each other mij, e.g. m12, m34, m56. since the cliord
matrices i transforms under o(6) as vectors

[mij, k] = i(ikj  jki),

i, j, k = 1...6,

neither of the matrices 1, ..., 6 commutes with all of the three generators
m12, m34, m56. on the other hand, the matrix 7 := q6
i=1 i commutes with
all generators mij. thus 7 is the fourth independent operator.

4g(f )

r

is a quantum number singlet in d = 72, which can be reduced to d=10 according
to (6) by imposing n = d/6 = 12 conditions on the physical states, i.e. 6 on each of the
sets (4) and (15). then for the compactication of the composite string to d=4 are used
n = d/6  3 = 9 constraints.

9

according to this we introduce rst three independent generators t12, t34,
t56. we choose t12 according to (19), since it denes the s, c, b, t-avour part
of the isospin projection. the remaining two generators are given by

t34 := {g(f )
t56 := {g(f )

r

r

, (34)r}
, (56)r}.

the fourth charge operator has the form
t7 := {g(f )

r

, (7)r}.

(21)
(22)

(23)

it commutes with (19), (21), (22) and with ln, gr. hence there exists a
common system of eigenfunctions for all these operators.

the operators t12, t34, t56, t7 can not directly be identied as avor quan-
tum number operators. in fact one has to consider the following four linear
combinations, which dene strangeness, charm, beauty and top

s := 

c := 
b := 
t := +

(t56 + t7),

(t34 + t7).

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

thus the physical quarks are described as superpositions of elementary string
elds. hence the quarks are composite objects in this model.

if we substitute (20) and (24)-(27) into the expression for the electric

charge

with the baryon charge b, we obtain

q = t3 + (s + b  c  t + b)/2

q = t 

3 + b/2.

(28)

this can be taken as a denition, which is independent of the quark avors
contained in the hadronic state. analogously the expression for the hyper-
charge in the quark model

y = s + b  c  t + b

10

together with (24)-(27) gives

y = b  2t12.

(29)

in case of t12 = 0 we have y = b for all states, containing only u- and
d-quarks.

the above constructions give a realization of the hadron quantum num-
bers q, b, t3, s, b, c, t in terms of the composite string operators. each given
hadron state can be interpreted as a wave function with the respective quan-
tum numbers in the composite string model.

the spin, isospin and baryon charge in the rst generation of ( u

d )-quarks
are realized from the a-set, while the s, c, b, t avours are realized on the
partner set a. thus the respective wave functions have the structure

< meson| =< 0, k|fafa, < baryon| =< 0, k|fafa

with < 0, k| =< 0| exp(ikx). in this fa is a compositions of components
from (4), symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the spin and isospin,
while fa carries the quantum numbers s, c, b, t, and the isospin projection
t12, and contains only components from a.

the fermion superconformal operator g(f )

r has d = 72 internal degrees
of freedom. notice, that the quark model contains 6 avors, 3 colours and 4
spin components, what also gives total number of 72 degrees of freedom.

finally we turn to the realization of the mass-spectrum of the hadron
resonances. let the strange fermion component gives a contribution of
m 2 = 0.3 gev2 to the mass of the physical state. this agrees with the
experimental fact of parallel -meson- and k -trajectories

m 2

k   m 2

 =

1
2 = 0.3gev2.

in this case the composite string model gives a much better description of
the physical mass spectrum then the quark model. in the quark model these
trajectories are not parallel.

4 discussion

a description of the hadron quantum numbers has been given in the compos-
ite string model in the simplest case of 8 component spinors in a compacti-
ed six-dimensional space. another possibility is to consider 32 component

11

spinors, what is natural in the critical d=10 string. there the number of cur-
rents obtained as pairs of 32 component spinors is equal to 496. this gives
d = 528 fermionic degrees of freedom. here we impose n = d/6 = 88
gauge conditions on physical states. this allows a simultaneous description
of the quarks and leptons in terms of the fermionic sector of the model. this
is a subject of further publications.

next we give the realization of the the quantum number operators in terms
of the components of the elementary string elds. the isospin operator t 
i
is given by

t 
i = xj,k

: (jkijk)0 : +

1

2 xl>0

( lil) + xj,k

: (jk + jk)0ijk : .

the lorentz-spin operator is dened as

(kt 

) = 

1

4 xl>0

k

l[, ]l + x : (kii + k + k)0 : .

the operators t12, t34, t56, t7 can be realized as

t12 = xr>0

r3r + x : (12)0 : +x : (1k2k)0 :,

t34 = xr>0
t56 = xr>0

r[3, 4]r + x : (34)0 : +xk
r[5, 6]r + x : (56)0 : +xk
t7 = xr>0
: (7kk)0 : .

r7r + xk

: (3k4k)0 :,

: (5k6k)0 :,
